# Core Principles

## Scope
This rule applies universally to all AI-assisted code generation in this project.

## Purpose
AI Coding Assistants should accelerate development, improve documentation and tests, and reduce repetitive work while avoiding subtle bugs, increased review load, or architectural drift.

## Core Principles

- Use disciplined workflows with clear constraints
- Maintain strong review practices
- Work in small, reviewable increments
- Prioritize correctness and simplicity over cleverness
- Always consider edge cases and risks
- Prefer static typing and type-checker feedback over intuition
- Use stateless terminal commands (each command should be runnable independently)
- Verify API details against authoritative docs when uncertain
- Keep files under 64KB for reliable operation

## Rationale
These principles ensure AI assistance enhances productivity without compromising code quality or introducing technical debt.

## Task Complexity Assessment

### Complexity Levels

- **L1 – Local**: Limited to one or two functions/files
- **L2 – Module**: Involves a whole feature or subsystem
- **L3 – Cross-System**: Affects architecture, multiple services, or shared contracts

### Risk Assessment by Task Type

**Strong Fit** (Proceed with standard workflows):
- Boilerplate & Glue Code (L1–L2)
- Tests & Documentation (L1–L2)
- Exploratory Spikes (L1–L2)

**Conditional Fit** (Require explicit approval and detailed planning):
- Local Feature Implementation (L1–L2)
- Refactoring (L1–L2)
- Bug Fixing & Debugging (L1–L2)

**High Risk** (Always require explicit approval, detailed plans, and risk assessment):
- Complex Feature Work (L3)
- Architectural Design (L3)
- Large Refactors (L3)

### High-Risk Task Requirements

For high-risk tasks, always:
- Request explicit approval before proceeding
- Provide detailed implementation plans and risk assessments
- Suggest breaking into smaller, lower-risk increments
- Explain architectural implications clearly

## Rationale
Complexity assessment helps match AI assistance intensity to task risk, preventing over-reliance on AI for critical architectural decisions.
