# Phase 6: Update README with Project Type Selector

## Outcome

The main `README.md` file is updated to include a project type selector that helps users choose between ML and conversational AI project types. The README:
- Adds a "Choose Your Project Type" section near the top
- Updates Quick Navigation table to include conversational AI route
- Adds links to `docs/choosing-project-type.md`
- Updates repository structure to show new directories (`/prompts/`, `/flows/`, `/examples/`)
- Maintains all existing content

A reviewer can read the README and immediately understand they can use this repository for both ML and conversational AI projects.

## Constraints & References

- **Current file:** `README.md`
- **Proposal reference:** `Repository_Evolution_Proposal.md` section 4 (lines 140) and section 5 (lines 223)
- **Project type guide:** `docs/choosing-project-type.md` (from Phase 1)
- **Format:** Follow existing README structure and style

## Acceptance Checks

- [ ] README.md includes "Choose Your Project Type" section
- [ ] Quick Navigation table includes conversational AI route
- [ ] Links to `docs/choosing-project-type.md` included
- [ ] Repository structure updated to show `/prompts/`, `/flows/`, `/examples/`
- [ ] All existing content maintained
- [ ] Documentation matches existing README style
- [ ] Clear guidance for both project types provided

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Does not create choosing-project-type.md (separate work item)
- Does not create example projects (separate work item)
- Does not create route docs (separate work item)
- Does not modify core documentation (README only)
