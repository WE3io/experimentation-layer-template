# Phase 6: Create End-to-End Example Projects

## Outcome

Example project directories exist in `/examples/` demonstrating both ML and conversational AI project types. The directory:
- Contains `examples/conversational-assistant/` with complete conversational AI project
- Contains `examples/ml-recommendation-system/` with complete ML project (if not exists)
- Each example includes README explaining the project structure
- Examples show real-world usage patterns

A reviewer can browse `/examples/` and see complete, working examples of both project types.

## Constraints & References

- **Location:** `/examples/` directory in repository root
- **Proposal reference:** `Repository_Evolution_Proposal.md` section 4 (lines 177-179)
- **Conversational AI:** Use prompts, flows, and experiment configs from previous phases
- **ML project:** Follow existing ML patterns if example exists

## Acceptance Checks

- [ ] Directory `/examples/conversational-assistant/` created
- [ ] Conversational AI example includes prompts, flows, and experiment config
- [ ] Conversational AI example includes README explaining structure
- [ ] ML example created or verified (if needed)
- [ ] Examples demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- [ ] Examples are complete and runnable (or clearly marked as templates)
- [ ] Examples link to relevant documentation

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Does not implement full services (examples/templates only)
- Does not create all possible examples (representative examples)
- Does not update README (separate work item)
- Does not write production code (examples/templates only)
