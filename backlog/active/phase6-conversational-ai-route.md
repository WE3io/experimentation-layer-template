# Phase 6: Write conversational-ai-route.md Guide

## Outcome

A new documentation file `docs/routes/conversational-ai-route.md` exists that provides a quickstart guide for conversational AI projects. The guide:
- Provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a conversational AI project
- Shows how to create prompts and flows
- Explains how to configure experiments with `execution_strategy: "prompt_template"`
- Includes a complete walkthrough from setup to first A/B test
- Links to all relevant documentation

A reviewer can follow the guide and have a conversational AI project running experiments within hours.

## Constraints & References

- **Location:** `docs/routes/conversational-ai-route.md`
- **Proposal reference:** `Repository_Evolution_Proposal.md` section 4 (lines 151) and section 5 (lines 254-260)
- **Pattern:** Follow structure of `docs/routes/experiment-route.md` or `docs/routes/training-route.md`
- **Documentation style:** Follow existing route documentation style
