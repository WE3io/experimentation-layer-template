# Consolidate or Archive Meta-Documentation

## Outcome

[docs/MEDIUM_PRIORITY_IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETED.md](../docs/MEDIUM_PRIORITY_IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETED.md) is archived or deleted. [docs/DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md](../docs/DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md) is streamlined to open items only, or archived if fully done.

## Constraints & References

- **Create** `docs/archive/` if archiving (directory does not exist)
- **Principle**: Maintenance burden exceeds long-term value for completed historical logs

## Acceptance Checks

- [x] MEDIUM_PRIORITY_IMPROVEMENTS_COMPLETED.md moved to docs/archive/ or deleted
- [x] DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md either: (a) contains only open items, or (b) archived/deleted, or (c) converted to short "Documentation maintenance" section in docs/README.md

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Does not add new improvement items; does not create ongoing maintenance checklist
