# Add Terminology Canonical Source

## Outcome

[docs/glossary.md](../docs/glossary.md) exists with 15–20 preferred terms (e.g., "conversational AI", execution strategies, EAS, EIS, unit types). [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) links to it under "Key terms".

## Constraints & References

- **Principle**: Single canonical location with references linking to it
- **Reference**: [docs/DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md](../docs/DOCUMENTATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md) item 9 (terminology)

## Acceptance Checks

- [x] docs/glossary.md created with 15–20 terms
- [x] docs/README.md includes "Key terms: [glossary.md](glossary.md)"

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Does not rename terms across all docs in one pass; glossary first, gradual alignment later
