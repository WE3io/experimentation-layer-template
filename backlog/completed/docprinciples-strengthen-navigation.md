# Strengthen Navigation

## Outcome

Route docs include "Prerequisites" linking to sequential path items. docs/README.md and architecture.md navigation verified. data-model.md has "See also" with links to assignment-service, experiments, and service API specs.

## Constraints & References

- **Principle**: Help readers navigate to related concepts
- **Routes**: [docs/routes/](../docs/routes/)

## Acceptance Checks

- [x] Each route doc has Prerequisites section with links to required sequential path items
- [x] docs/README.md "Start Here If" links to choosing-project-type for new projects
- [x] architecture.md "Start Here If" includes choosing-project-type (verify present)
- [x] data-model.md "See also" links to assignment-service, experiments, service API specs

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Does not restructure navigation; only adds missing links
