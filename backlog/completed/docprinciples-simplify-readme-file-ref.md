# Simplify docs/README File Reference

## Outcome

[docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) "File Reference" table is reduced to a compact quick-lookup or removed. Sequential Learning Path remains primary navigation.

## Constraints & References

- **Primary nav**: Sequential Learning Path
- **Principle**: Avoid redundancy between phased listing and file table

## Acceptance Checks

- [x] File Reference either: (a) compact table (filename + one-line purpose only), or (b) removed
- [x] Sequential Learning Path unchanged

## Explicit Non-Goals

- Does not change learning path order; does not remove docs/README.md
